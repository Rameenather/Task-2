# Task-2
Note taking

Notes from a video on 2 topic of interest:

First Topic:
Algorithmic complexity
-Algorithm: Set of instructions set to solve a problem independent to the hardware/programming language.
-Type of listing alogorithms:
Bubble sort: Switches with the higher until the highest is at one end and the lowest at the other
Merge sort: Splits into pairs of 2, lists them from small to large in each pair and then add two pairs together and do the same thing, carry on with this until the list is sorted.

Second Topic:
Information theory:
-Study of properties of information, which include things such as how it can be measured, stored, communicated ,etc.
-Things included in this are:
Compression
-For taking up less memeory while having all the important information
Error correction
-Coding theory
Cryptography
-keeping data secure while communicating. (sometimes using complex math problems)

Question from info:
-Define algorithm?
-List 2 types of algorithms 
-What is an algorithm used for?

-Give three parts of information that are studied
-What does compression mean?
-What happens in cryptography?
